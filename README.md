In this project, we performed explorotary data analysis and answered three hypotheses based on the dataset. we used statiscts to analyze this data.
Here are three possible hypotheses:
* The survival rate is associated to the class of passenger
* The survival rate is associated to the gender
* The survival rate is associated to the age
And For each hypothesis, we have a plot.


### Prerequisites

We need Pandas and MatPlotLib packages to perform analysis and draw plots.

  ```sh
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  ```
